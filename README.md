BetterKnife
==========

Fork of [SwissKnife](https://github.com/Arasthel/SwissKnife) with the main idea of automating as much boilerplate work previously done by developer by hand even with using libraries like ButterKnife, SwissKnife etc.

You won't see any `inject()` or `subscribe()`-like methods anymore until you want to achieve some weird behavior.

It's **Groovy**, baby! Nobody likes to write boilerplate code, so let's get rid of it!
